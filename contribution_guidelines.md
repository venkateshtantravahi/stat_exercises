## Guidelines for Contributions

### Notebook Format:
- Only use **Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb`) for submissions.
- Ensure your notebooks are **clean** before submission:
  - Remove unnecessary outputs and logs (e.g., kernel warnings).
  - Restart the kernel and run all cells to ensure consistency.

### Coding Style:
- Follow **Python 3.x** syntax.
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable names in your code.
- Add **comments** explaining the purpose of each section or calculation.
- Use **Markdown cells** to explain topics, scenarios, and instructions for exercises clearly.

### File Naming:
- Use **snake_case** for all notebook filenames (e.g., `mean_median_mode.ipynb`).
- Name your notebook files to reflect their content (e.g., `boxplots_visualization.ipynb`).

### Structure for New Notebooks:
1. **Introduction**: Begin with a markdown cell introducing the topic and its relevance.
2. **Dataset**: Provide a link to the dataset used and load it in the first code cell.
3. **Exercises**: Pose scenario-based questions and guide the user to solve them with Python code and visualizations.
4. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings from the exercises.
5. Include links to **external resources** (e.g., articles or videos) for additional learning.

### Datasets:
- Use publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository) and provide proper attribution.
- If including small datasets in the repository, place them in a `datasets/` folder with a `README.md` explaining their source and usage.

### Visualization Standards:
- Use libraries such as **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, or **plotly** for visualizations.
- Ensure plots have proper titles, axis labels, and legends (if applicable).

### File Location:
- Place your notebooks in the appropriate sub-folder within `notebooks/` (e.g., `descriptive_statistics/`, `visualization/`).
- If no suitable sub-folder exists, propose a new one in your PR.

2. Add your notebook file(s) and push your changes.
3. Submit a pull request with a **clear description** of your contribution (e.g., "Added boxplot visualization exercises to the visualization folder").

### Respect Existing Files:
- Do not modify critical files like `README.md`, `LICENSE`, or other contributors' work unless you‚Äôre fixing an error.
